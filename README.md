Our team, comprised of Tala Alfuhaid, Ghadeer Almansour, Najd Alnafisah, Jenan Almeshari, and Raghad Alzamil, is collaborating to utilize machine learning methods for the analysis and prediction of heart attacks using the 'Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction' dataset. We have chosen this subject due to the prevalent occurrence of heart attacks. Through our dataset analysis, we aim to assess the probability of experiencing a heart attack.
